Today I would like to introduce a new project to you: the [UWCxBlogs newsletter](/newsletter/).

When I started UWCxBlogs in 2013, my intention was to give UWC applicants a glimpse into life at UWC. At the time I was waiting impatiently to start my own UWC experience at [Waterford Kamhlaba UWC](/#waterford+kamhlaba+uwc). I had soaked up every bit of UWC promotional material, but I still couldn't quite imagine what UWC would be like. So I read through every blog about UWC I could find and eventually created UWCxBlogs to share the blogs with other UWC hopefuls.

Now UWCxBlogs has grown to include over 350 blogs. That's a lot of content! So each month I will handpick an insightful & inspirational post from a blog on UWCxBlogs and share it with you in this newsletter.

What do you think? Do you have wishes or ideas for the newsletter? I’d love to hear your opinion! Just reply to this email or say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/connor_baer).

See you next month!
