# UWC Blogs

_A collection of over 350 blogs written by UWC students in 28 languages from 76 countries at the 17 United World Colleges._

I strive to make this list as extensive as possible so that everybody can find a blog for their favorite college in their native language. This wouldn't be possible without you. Thanks to everybody who submitted a blog! You have a blog yourself or know one that isn't listed here? Submit the link [here](http://uwcblogs.com/submit) and I'll add it as soon as possible. Thank you!
