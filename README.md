# UWC Blogs

_A collection of over 300 blogs in 20 languages written by UWC students from more than 55 countries at the 17 United World Colleges._

I strive to make this list as extensive as possible so that everybody can find a blog for their favorite college in their native language. This wouldn't be possible without you. Thanks to everybody who submitted a blog! You have a blog yourself or know one that isn't listed here? Submit the link [here](http://uwcblogs.com/submissions) and I'll add it as soon as possible. Thank you!
