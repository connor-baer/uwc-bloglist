# UWC Blogs

_A collection of over 350 blogs written by UWC students in 28 languages from 76 countries at the 17 United World Colleges._

When I started UWC Blogs in 2013, my intention was to give UWC applicants a glimpse into life at UWC. At the time I was waiting impatiently to start my own UWC experience at [UWC Waterford Kamhlaba](https://uwcblogs.com/uwc-waterford-kamhlaba). I had soaked up every bit of UWC promotional material, but I still couldn't quite imagine what UWC would be like. So I read through every blog about UWC I could find and eventually created [UWC Blogs](https://uwcblogs.com) to share the blogs with other UWC hopefuls.

I strive to make the list as extensive as possible so that everybody can find a blog for their favorite college in their native language. This wouldn't be possible without you. Thanks to everybody who submitted a blog! Do you blog about UWC or know a blog that isn't listed here? [Submit the link](https://uwcblogs.com/submit) and I'll add it as soon as possible.
